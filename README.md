# ECS522U - Group 35 Weather application

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js

### Installation

Clone and `cd` into the project directory.

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

### Usage

The root project directory should already contain a .env file with a OpenWeather API key. If not create a .env file and enter the following secret keys:

```env
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
```

If you choose to use your own OpenWeather API key, you must be subscribed to the Developer plan as well as the One Call API subscription plan to allow for some API calls to be made.

### Running

Run the React app by running the following command in the root project directory:

```
$ npm start
```

The web browser should automatically open to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000)
